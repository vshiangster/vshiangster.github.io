    <p class="blogSiteTitle">Utilizing Scraps as a Creative Challenge</p>
    <p class="blogSiteDate">Date: April 14, 2025</p>
    <p class="blogPara2">
      &emsp;&emsp;This bag was made super on the fly. I was at Purdueâ€™s
      Knowledge Lab (where I do all of my sewing these days), just looking
      through their bins of fabric when a nice thick piece of navy blue fabric
      caught my eye. Not too much fabric, just enough to make a small bag. I
      scoured the other bins for blue scrap fabric, pulling any blue fabric I
      saw out. Then, looking at the fabric I had lying in a pile on the floor, I
      decided to create a small patchwork style handbag. Now luckily, bag
      patterns are pretty simple to make- the patterns mostly work like how
      boxes do. So I quickly whipped up a handbag pattern, and got to sewing. I
      cut out the two faces of the bag, sewing on the scraps in a random
      fashion, trying to arrange them in a way that would be the most visually
      appealing. I did not worry about fabric fraying for this project, and in
      fact used it to my advantage. Some patches I rolled the hems of while
      others I did not, amplifying that patchwork look. In the end, I think I
      achieved a pretty cool result.
