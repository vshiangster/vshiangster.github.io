      &emsp;&emsp;As I was entering middle school, Greta Thunburg’s efforts in
      protests and spreading awareness was at its peak. However, as a newly
      turned 12 year old, I found the concept of climate change frightening- how
      could the planet be fading away when I had barely lived yet? From then on,
      I started a series of small actions in attempts to mitigate my carbon
      output such as avoiding consuming beef, bringing reusable bags to stores,
      and much more. Fast forward a few years to senior year of high school
      where I had taken up a new hobby: sewing. I quickly realized that sewing
      could be utilized to upcycle unused clothes and excess fabric waste. This
      piece was inspired by my dream of ending climate change, so I decided to
      upcycle clothes as the medium. In addition, the flower design was
      influenced by “The Time Machine,” by H.G. Wells. In the novel, flowers
      represent a multitude of things such

      as kindness and empathy persisting despite the fact that time has passed
      drastically. This felt like a perfect motif to sew into this new pair of
      jeans as I hope people will approach our planet with kindness and empathy.

      &emsp;&emsp;When my sister moved out to college, she left boxes and boxes
      of clothes at index. For that, I will always be thankful for as that pile
      of clothing is one of my #1 visited spots when I need fabric.
      Specifically, when I am trying to modify something existing, rather than
      making a piece from scratch. By digging through my sister’s clothes, I
      managed to find three pairs of pretty skinny jeans. Only by using three,
      would I get the target fit I wanted for this pair of pants. So, I used a
      seam ripper to disassemble the pairs of pants, using one for the base,
      while using the others to make up fabric on the width, length, and leg
      openings.

      &emsp;&emsp;Now although this was a fairly time consuming aspect, I had
      not gotten to the main performer of the show yet– the sunflower design I
      was going to put onto the pants. I revisited my sister’s pile of unwanted
      clothes yet again, pulling out yellow, orange, white, green and brown
      clothes I saw. Then, I cut pieces out of these clothes (in optimal spots
      so I could later modify those clothes too) to make the petals, leaves,
      disc florets. Next, I had to HAND SEW each part of the flower onto the
      pants. I used embroidery thread to sew each piece of the flower on, as I
      wanted to emphasize the stitched patchwork effect. To make this process
      slightly faster, I first used double sided tape to tack a piece onto the
      pants before hand sewing it down. I then repeated this process over and
      over again, using an array of embroidery thread, before finishing the
      project.
