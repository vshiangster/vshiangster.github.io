    <p class="blogSiteTitle">The Journey of Making my Senior Prom Dress</p>
    <p class="blogSiteDate">Date: April 14, 2025</p>
    <p class="blogPara">
      &emsp;&emsp;This piece took incredibly long to make. I remember being
      naive and hopeful, starting the project months before prom took place, yet
      I was still working on finishing touches the night before prom, working
      late into the evening. Despite this, this project was incredibly fun to
      make. I was trying my best to put out the best quality work as it would be
      viewed upon by my peers at school and I wanted to look pretty on prom day.
      I was first inspired to take up this project when I was looking through
      prom dresses online. The prices were absurd. Some dresses went as high as
      $200+. I was not about to pay that price, as my parents were already kinda
      annoyed at the prom ticket prices which were around $100. Was spending
      days of my time and a good amount of money on the actual fabric itself a
      much better solution? No, not really but it was a lot of fun.

      &emsp;&emsp;I first started this project by creating a pattern! If I was
      going to create a prom dress, I was going to go all out, and this included
      making my own pattern for the dress. I searched up a tutorial on how to
      make a pencil skirt block out, and then modified the pattern from there,
      adding on lots of length so the skirt of my dress would be flowy and yet
      form fitting at the same time. I also created a corset top pattern,
      modifying a pattern I found on YouTube. After drawing out these patterns,
      I traced them onto my muslin fabric (a budget friendly fabric used to test
      patterns out) and sewed together all the pieces, creating my first
      official mock up. I tried this mock up on, taking notes on everything that
      I needed to fix, and then applying those changes. This cycle went on two
      more times, making a few changes to the pattern, resewing it together, and
      then trying it on until I reached a product I was satisfied with. This
      test process is extremely long and I would estimate it takes up 70% of the
      total time.

      &emsp;&emsp;Finally, I could get started on sewing the ACTUAL dress. I
      headed over to my favorite fabric shop in California and picked up a few
      yards of light blue satin and tulle. I first started with the corset top,
      using tulle as the main component of the top and satin as the bone lining
      and cups. Then, I moved onto the skirt whose base is made up of satin,
      then layered with tulle to amplify the flowy effect. Last but not least, I
      used some embroidered tulle I had lying around and sewed that onto the
      dress, resulting in embroidered flowers wrapped all around the dress. I
      was actually very scared the dress would break on the actual day of prom
      as I had accidentally sewn the hip too narrowly, making it so I could
      barely sit down. However, as the night went on the dress only became more
      comfortable to wear and did not break! I would call that a success.
