      &emsp;&emsp;Hi! My name is Vivian Shiang and I am the creator, designer,
      and seamstress of Vivian's Sewing (shocker)! I am a Freshman at Purdue
      University studying Game Development. One of my biggest hobbies is sewing!
      My grandma taught me how to sew when I was in elementary school. Although
      I do not remember any sewing skills from that time, it was the first time
      sewing and remains as a fond memory for me. I ACTUALLY started sewing
      during Junior to Senior year of summer. All of a sudden, I had the strong
      urge to learn how to sew as there were so many clothes lying around the
      house but no one was using them! Maybe I could turn them into something
      new that would breath new life into these pieces of clothing.So that
      summer, I spent all of my time turning two pairs of jeans into an over the
      shoulder bag (anniversary gift for my boyfriend).

    <p class="blogPara2">
      &emsp;&emsp;I discovered how fun sewing was- it was like a puzzle, having
      to fit each piece of fabric with each other in a perfect way where no
      seams were showing, yet achieving the desired shape. On top of that, I
      love making anything with my hands and sewing covered this itch. I got to
      run my hands through the fabric and my feet on the foot pedal. The
      tactical feeling of sewing drove me to love sewing even further and since
      then, I have never really stopped sewing. I'm trying new techniques, new
      fabrics, and new projects to push myself to learn and deepen my
      understanding of sewing more and more. My favorite thing to sew are pants
      because the pattern for pants are pretty simple and easy to make
      modifications to. I just think there are so many different ways to change
      pants whether it is silhouette, design, and fabrics. On a similar wave
      length, my absolute favorite fabric to work with is denim. It is such a
      strong fabric that can really resist anything. I love how versatile it is
      and how the needle sounds when puncturing layers of denim.
